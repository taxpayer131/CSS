          <p>Javascript Basics</p>

          <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developer to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

          <ul class="js_content">
            <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a>Javascript variables are container for strong data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaSript variables must identified with uniquue names.  These unique names are called identifiers.  var x;</li>

            <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variable - your cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;</li>

            <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</li>

            <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform erent actions for erent decisions - hitting erent code blocks based on values or conditions that have neeen met.  You can use conditional statments in your coce to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our coe block; else if to specifiy a new contiditon to test, if the first condition is fals; else we execute this block of code;</li>

            <li><a href="">Loops</a> There are many erent kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same things: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  That's a loop!</li>

            <li><a href="">Functions</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  When we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as aa list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Idea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up.  Done!  We finsihed our instructions.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.</li>
